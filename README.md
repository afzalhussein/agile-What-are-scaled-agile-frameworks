Scaled Agile Frameworks (SAFe) are a set of structured approaches and guidelines that organizations use to scale Agile principles and practices beyond individual teams. These frameworks are designed to help larger enterprises and organizations apply Agile methodologies to large, complex projects that involve multiple teams, products, and stakeholders. SAFe frameworks provide a structured way to coordinate, plan, and execute Agile practices at scale while maintaining alignment with the organization's strategic goals.

Some of the most well-known Scaled Agile Frameworks include:

1. **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework):** SAFe is one of the most widely adopted and comprehensive frameworks for scaling Agile. It provides a detailed set of roles, responsibilities, and practices at the team, program, and portfolio levels. SAFe includes guidance for areas such as Agile Release Trains (ARTs), Lean-Agile principles, and the SAFe Big Picture. It's designed to align teams and stakeholders, improve collaboration, and facilitate the delivery of value in large organizations.

2. **LeSS (Large Scale Scrum):** LeSS is an adaptation of the Scrum framework for large-scale environments. It simplifies the Scrum framework and emphasizes empiricism, transparency, and continuous improvement. LeSS focuses on keeping the product development organization as simple as possible while promoting lean thinking and collaboration among teams.

3. **Nexus:** Nexus is a framework specifically designed for scaling Scrum. It extends the Scrum framework by providing guidelines for organizing and coordinating multiple Scrum teams working on a single product. Nexus maintains the core Scrum roles and events while introducing additional roles and artifacts to ensure alignment and integration across teams.

4. **Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD):** DAD is a process decision framework that provides a range of lifecycles and delivery options, allowing organizations to choose the Agile and lean approaches that best fit their specific context. It supports a wide variety of Agile and lean practices, including Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP). DAD focuses on the full delivery lifecycle, including architecture, design, programming, and testing.

5. **Spotify Model:** While not a formal framework, the Spotify model is a popular approach to scaling Agile that emphasizes a culture of autonomy, alignment, and a decentralized approach to organizing teams. It's based on the idea of "squads" (small cross-functional teams) that are organized into "tribes," "chapters," and "guilds." This model encourages teams to align their work with organizational goals while retaining a high degree of autonomy.

These scaled Agile frameworks offer different approaches to addressing the challenges of scaling Agile practices and principles within large organizations. The choice of which framework to use depends on factors such as the organization's size, culture, existing processes, and specific needs. Organizations often tailor and customize these frameworks to fit their unique context and requirements.
